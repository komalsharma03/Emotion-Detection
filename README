# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system that detects and classifies human emotions from uploaded images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The application is built using Python and integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The project combines cutting-edge techniques from machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design to provide real-time emotion classification. The solution targets real-world applications in domains like healthcare, education, and customer service, where emotion recognition can offer valuable insights.
#Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and optimize a complete system that allows users to upload images, detects faces, and classifies emotions using pre-trained CNN models. The system is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to use, with a focus on enhancing emotion detection capabilities using state-of-the-art models and techniques.
